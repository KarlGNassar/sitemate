## Features:
- dockerized mongodb instance
- logs
- request body validation
- toast (ui)
- next js server components with server actions (ui)


## Things to improve (due to time constraints and non production env):
- implement UPDATE functionality
- use elastic search for logs
- improve UI and UX

## What I could've done better:
- better time management (spent most of my time coding the backend)
- used easier and faster development stack (react instead of next, plain JS instead of TS)
